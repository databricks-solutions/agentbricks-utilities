## Please follow these guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and maintain code quality.

### Creating New Utilities
For contributors developing new utilities, create a new folder under utilities/ and place all related files inside that folder.

Include a README.md specific to your utility that explains:

1. Project purpose and functionality

1. Installation instructions

1. Usage examples

### Coding and Testing
All contributions must be tested and code reviewed before merging into dev or main.

If your work is in-progress or not fully tested, keep it in a separate feature branch until it’s ready for review.

### Adding Dependencies
If your utility introduces new libraries, include the library name, version, copyright, and source in the repository’s main README.md.

Libraries that are not open-source must go through legal review before inclusion.

### Submitting Contributions
Clone the repository and create a new branch (e.g., feature/your-utility-name).

Commit descriptive changes with clear messages.

Push your branch and open a pull request targeting dev.

Request a review before merging.

Repeat for main branch, which is protected, requiring an approving review before a successful merge.

### Code Style and Documentation
Follow the existing code style standards used in the repository.

Keep commit messages concise yet meaningful.

Ensure all documentation and examples are up to date.
