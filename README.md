# AgentBricks Utilities

```
Includes utilities and plugins extending AgentBricks to improve gaps in the product, specifically focusing on product-market fit, filling perceived gaps as perceived by customers or the field, or Generally the goal of this repo is not example implementations, though functioning streaming or incremental code would absolutely be included since that is more of a product-market fit issue. As features get rolled into the product and each utility becomes less useful weâ€™ll archive them.
```

## 

## Installation

Generally the utilities here can be copy-pasted from a notebook or the repo simply cloned for their use. If a project requires a DAB deploy or other implementation it will say so in the project-specific readme.
