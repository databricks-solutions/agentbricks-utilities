# AgentBricks Utilities

Includes utilities and plugins extending AgentBricks and related features such as Databricks AI functions.

The goal of utilties in this repo is to improve gaps in the product, specifically focusing on product-market fit, filling perceived gaps as perceived by customers or the field, or addressing challenges that customers face during POCs or other engagements.

The primary goal of this repo is not example implementations, though sometimes examples that direct customers more strongly toward approaches that integrate better with customer deployments such as functioning streaming or incremental code would absolutely be included since that is more of a product-market fit issue. As features get rolled into the product and each utility becomes less useful weâ€™ll remove features and/or archive the repository.
## 

## Installation

Generally the utilities here can be copy-pasted from a notebook or the repo simply cloned for their use. If a project requires a DAB deploy or other implementation it will say so in the project-specific readme.
